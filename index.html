<p>The maintenance model of Java framework:</p>
<ul>
    <li>[x] Follow up on emerging technologies</li>
    <li>[x] An active and stable field of technology</li>
    <li>[x] Modules waiting for repair</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="followuponemergingtechnologies">Follow up on emerging technologies:</h1>
<p>Some frameworks will closely monitor the latest technologies released in Java news, such as JDK21.<br />
    Pursuing low coupling and more advanced technological fields, adapting well to the next major update of Java technology foundation.  </p>
<h1 id="anactiveandstablefieldoftechnology">An active and stable field of technology:</h1>
<p>Some frameworks will choose widely used versions, such as JDK11.<br />
    After a period of significant updates, the minimum JDK version supported by most frameworks will directly jump from 8 to 17.<br />
    Choose widely used technology versions to provide convenience for developers.  </p>
<h1 id="moduleswaitingforrepair">Modules waiting for repair:</h1>
<p>Some frameworks will be temporarily unavailable and will stop updating.<br />
    All modules can run stably, which is a challenge in the Java model and a goal that all developers need to achieve.<br />
    This is because a large number of popular frameworks are undergoing significant updates.<br />
    Gradually search for stable modules and then update them step by step.  </p>
