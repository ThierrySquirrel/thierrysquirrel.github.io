    </ul>
    <h1 id="heading-1">Follow up on emerging technologies:</h1>
    <p>Some frameworks will closely monitor the latest technologies released in Java news, such as JDK21.<br>Pursuing low coupling and more advanced technological fields, adapting well to the next major update of Java technology foundation.  </p>
    <h1 id="heading-2">An active and stable field of technology:</h1>
    <p>Some frameworks will choose widely used versions, such as JDK11.<br>After a period of significant updates, the minimum JDK version supported by most frameworks will directly jump from 8 to 17.<br>Choose widely used technology versions to provide convenience for developers.  </p>
    <h1 id="heading-3">Modules waiting for repair:</h1>
    <p>Some frameworks will be temporarily unavailable and will stop updating.<br>All modules can run stably, which is a challenge in the Java model and a goal that all developers need to achieve.<br>This is because a large number of popular frameworks are undergoing significant updates.<br>Gradually search for stable modules and then update them step by step.  </p>
