# Follow up on emerging technologies:
Some frameworks will closely monitor the latest technologies released in Java news, such as JDK21.  
Pursuing low coupling and more advanced technological fields, adapting well to the next major update of Java technology foundation.  

# An active and stable field of technology:
Some frameworks will choose widely used versions, such as JDK11.  
After a period of significant updates, the minimum JDK version supported by most frameworks will directly jump from 8 to 17.  
Choose widely used technology versions to provide convenience for developers.  

# Modules waiting for repair:
Some frameworks will be temporarily unavailable and will stop updating.  
All modules can run stably, which is a challenge in the Java model and a goal that all developers need to achieve.  
This is because a large number of popular frameworks are undergoing significant updates.  
Gradually search for stable modules and then update them step by step.
